# Contributing to OneWireReader

We love your input! We want to make contributing to OneWireReader as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

All code changes happen through pull requests. They are the best way to propose changes to the codebase:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) (recommended) or Arduino IDE
- Git for version control
- A SparkFun Pro Micro or compatible Arduino Leonardo-style board for testing

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/OneWireReader.git
   cd OneWireReader
   ```

2. **Install PlatformIO** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   pip install platformio
   ```

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   platformio run
   ```

4. **Upload to your test hardware**
   ```bash
   platformio run --target upload
   ```

## Code Style Guidelines

### C++ Code Standards

- **Indentation**: Use 2 spaces, no tabs
- **Naming conventions**:
  - Variables: `camelCase`
  - Functions: `camelCase()`
  - Constants: `UPPER_CASE`
- **Comments**: Use `//` for single-line comments, `/* */` for multi-line
- **Line length**: Keep lines under 80 characters when possible

### Example Code Style

```cpp
// Good
OneWire ds(10);  // OneWire on pin 10 (4.7K resistor required)

void setup(void) {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Keyboard.begin();
}

// Function with proper spacing and comments
void readOneWireDevice() {
  byte addr[8];
  char str[20];
  
  if (!ds.search(addr)) {
    Serial.println("No more addresses.");
    ds.reset_search();
    delay(250);
    return;
  }
  
  // Format and output the ROM address
  Serial.print("ROM =");
  for (byte i = 1; i <= 8; i++) {
    sprintf(str, "%02x", addr[8-i]);
    Serial.print(str);
    Keyboard.print(str);
  }
  
  Keyboard.println();
  delay(500);
}
```

## Commit Message Conventions

We follow conventional commit format for clear and searchable history:

### Format
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Types
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples
```
feat: add support for different OneWire pins
fix: correct hex formatting for single-digit values
docs: update wiring diagram in README
refactor: simplify device scanning loop
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if you change functionality
2. **Test your changes** on actual hardware if possible
3. **Update the CHANGELOG.md** with details of changes
4. **Ensure all checks pass** (build, style, etc.)

### Pull Request Template
